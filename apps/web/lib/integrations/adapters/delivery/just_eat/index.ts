/**
 * Just Eat adapter (stub).
 *
 * Minimum-viable implementation — declares `search` + `details`
 * capabilities, returns an empty search result set, and throws on
 * `getDetails`. This exists so the registry can list Just Eat
 * as a known provider while the real connector is being negotiated.
 * Replace the method bodies (and expand capabilities) when a real
 * client lands.
